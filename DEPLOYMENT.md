# 🚀 Jet AI - Production Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying Jet AI in production environments for your demo and beyond.

## 📦 PyPI Deployment

### **1. Build and Test Locally**
```bash
# Clean previous builds
rm -rf dist/ build/ src/*.egg-info/

# Build package
python -m build --sdist --wheel

# Test installation
pip install dist/jet_ai_sdk-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

### **2. Upload to PyPI**
```bash
# Install twine
pip install twine

# Upload to TestPyPI first
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test installation from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ jet-ai-sdk

# Upload to production PyPI
twine upload dist/*
```

### **3. Verify Installation**
```bash
pip install jet-ai-sdk
python -c "from jet import quick_train; print('✅ Jet AI installed successfully!')"
```

## 🎯 Demo Preparation

### **Quick Demo Script**
```python
# demo_quick.py
from jet import quick_train, list_available_models

print("🚀 Jet AI Demo")
print("=" * 40)

# Show available models
models = list_available_models()
print(f"📚 {len(models)} models available")

# Quick training demo
trainer = quick_train(
    "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct",
    "databricks/databricks-dolly-15k",
    test_prompts=["What is AI?", "Explain machine learning"]
)

print("✅ Demo completed!")
```

### **Investor Presentation Points**
1. **Problem**: API dependency costs $1000s/month
2. **Solution**: Own your model for $30-100 one-time
3. **Demo**: 3-line code to train custom model
4. **ROI**: Break even in days, not months
5. **Market**: Every AI startup needs this

## 🔧 Production Considerations

### **GPU Requirements**
- **Minimum**: RTX 4090 (24GB) for small models
- **Recommended**: A100 (40GB) for medium models
- **Enterprise**: H100 (80GB) for large models

### **Scaling Strategy**
1. **Phase 1**: Single GPU training (current)
2. **Phase 2**: Multi-GPU with DeepSpeed
3. **Phase 3**: GPU clusters with vast.ai
4. **Phase 4**: Custom infrastructure

### **Monitoring & Logging**
- MLflow tracks all experiments
- GPU utilization monitoring
- Cost tracking per training job
- Model performance metrics

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

### **Data Privacy**
- No data leaves your infrastructure
- Models trained on your hardware
- Complete control over data flow

### **Model Ownership**
- You own the trained model
- No vendor lock-in
- Deploy anywhere, anytime

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### **Training Times (RTX 4090)**
- Phi-3-mini (3.8B): 30 minutes
- Phi-3-small (7B): 1 hour
- Phi-3-medium (14B): 2 hours

### **Cost Analysis**
- Training cost: $0.25-3.00
- Your price: $30-100
- Margin: 1,000-12,000%

## 🎯 Go-to-Market Strategy

### **Target Customers**
1. **AI Startups**: Replace API dependencies
2. **Enterprises**: Custom model training
3. **Researchers**: Academic model development
4. **Developers**: Personal AI projects

### **Pricing Strategy**
- **Freemium**: Basic models on CPU
- **Starter**: $30 for small models
- **Pro**: $50 for medium models
- **Enterprise**: $100 for large models

### **Sales Pitch**
> "Stop being a wrapper business. Own your AI models for the price of a meal. Train custom models in minutes, not months. Break even in days, not years."

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to PyPI** ✅
2. **Create landing page** 
3. **Launch on Product Hunt**
4. **Community outreach**
5. **Investor meetings**
